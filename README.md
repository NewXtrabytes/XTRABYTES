# NEW XTRABYTES - The Privacy Version of Xtrabytes!

We are aiming to create a new xtrabytes with a full community feel. We will be applying DAG technology to the chain to boost the TPS to 25,000 Tx by using our patented lattice technology. We Aim to have everything sorted and worked out soon. We are also hiring new developers and will be implementing an altered version of static nodes that anyone can afford. We will also apply our new concensus algorithm which is based on Null to apply absolute privacy to the chain.
